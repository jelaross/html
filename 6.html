<h4>One day, a few hunters came into the forest and took the lion with them. They tied up him against a tree. The lion was struggling to get out and started to whimper. Soon, the mouse walked papst and noticed the lion in trouble. Quickly, he ran and gnawed on the ropes to set the lion free. Both of them speed off into the jungle.</h4>
